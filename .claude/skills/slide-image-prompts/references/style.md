# Pop Art Comic Book Style Guide

## Overview

All slide images should follow a consistent pop art comic book aesthetic inspired by classic Roy Lichtenstein and modern comic art, but cleaner and more minimalist for presentation clarity.

## Style Block

Use this block in all prompts:

```
Clean bold black outlines, not too busy. Color palette: electric blue, red, yellow, black, white. Subtle Ben-Day dots in background only. Main subject POPS against the background.
```

## Core Principles

### 1. Clean Over Busy

| DO                         | DON'T                             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Bold, clear outlines       | Scratchy, sketchy lines           |
| Simple compositions        | Cluttered scenes                  |
| One focal point            | Multiple competing elements       |
| Readable at thumbnail size | Details that disappear when small |

### 2. Color Palette

**Primary colors** (use liberally):

- Electric blue (#0066FF or similar)
- Bright red (#FF0000 or similar)
- Yellow (#FFFF00 or similar)
- Pure black (#000000)
- Pure white (#FFFFFF)

**Accent colors** (use sparingly):

- Purple (for Ada's hair/hoodie consistency)
- Green (for success/growth moments)
- Orange (for energy/warmth)

### 3. Ben-Day Dots

- **Usage**: Background accents ONLY
- **Density**: Subtle, not overwhelming
- **Purpose**: Add pop art authenticity without distracting
- **Avoid**: Dots on faces, main subjects, or text areas

### 4. Outlines

- **Weight**: Bold and consistent (think 3-5px equivalent)
- **Color**: Pure black for main subjects
- **Style**: Clean, smooth curves - not jagged or rough
- **Shadows**: Use solid black shapes, not gradient shadows

## Composition Guidelines

### Aspect Ratio

Always specify: `16:9 aspect ratio`

This matches standard presentation slides.

### Focal Point

Every image must have ONE clear focal point:

- Ada should dominate 40-60% of the frame
- Supporting elements should frame, not compete
- Negative space is okay - it helps slides breathe

### Caption/Title Integration

Speech bubbles and captions should:

- Use angular, comic-style bubble shapes
- Have bold black outlines
- Use ALL CAPS for text
- Be positioned where they don't cover Ada's face
- Be readable even when the slide is viewed from a distance

## Reference Examples

### Good Style Keywords to Include

```
- "Pop art comic book illustration"
- "Clean bold black outlines"
- "Not too busy"
- "Main subject POPS"
- "16:9 aspect ratio"
```

### Style Keywords to Avoid

```
- "Realistic" (conflicts with comic style)
- "Detailed" (leads to busy images)
- "Photorealistic" (wrong aesthetic)
- "3D rendering" (wrong aesthetic)
- "Watercolor" or "painterly" (wrong aesthetic)
```

## Energy Levels

Match the visual energy to the slide content:

| Content Type   | Visual Energy        | Style Notes                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Opening/Title  | High - dramatic      | Cape flowing, dynamic pose, bold colors         |
| Teaching       | Medium - focused     | Ada pointing/gesturing, clear visual aids       |
| Warning        | Medium-high - urgent | Red accents, concerned expression, motion lines |
| Transformation | High - dynamic       | Before/after composition, movement lines        |
| Closing        | High - triumphant    | Power pose, bright colors, upward motion        |

## Technical Specifications

For image generation, always include:

1. **Format declaration**: `Pop art comic book illustration, 16:9 aspect ratio.`
2. **Character block**: From `character.md`
3. **Scene description**: Unique to the slide
4. **Style block**: From this document
5. **Caption specification**: `Bold caption in angular speech bubble: "[SLIDE TITLE]"`
