# Leveling Up With AI - Talk Outline

A practical map for learning, working, and building with AI. Grounded in lived use, not hype.

## Part 1: Mental Models, Not Magic

**Core Message**: This talk is about mental models for AI, not specific tools. Understanding HOW to think about AI matters more than which app to use.

### Slides

1. **Title: Mental Models, Not Magic**
   - The real starting point
   - Mood: Foundational, important

2. **This talk is not about tools**
   - It's about mental models
   - How you think about what a tool IS, what it can do, and how you work with it over time

3. **The Google Analogy**
   - Google made the internet's corpus usable
   - Getting "good at Google" wasn't about features
   - It was about internalizing a mental model

4. **Learning to Think Like Google**
   - What you first tried: "Please give me directions to the nearest ice cream store which is called Molly Moon."
   - What you learned: `Molly Moon directions Google Maps`

5. **Chatbots: The Next Step**
   - ChatGPT and Claude are like a savant friend
   - Who knows the entire corpus
   - And can reason across domains

6. **The Real Leap: Execution**
   - With coding tools, agents, and workflows...
   - You are no longer talking to a friend
   - You are directing digital employees

7. **At Scale**
   - You don't do the execution
   - You don't even do most of the coordination
   - You become a top-level director

8. **The Expanded Mental Model**
   - "I now have access to the world's corpus of knowledge AND the ability to make things digitally."

9. **Key Insight**
   - Understanding only arrives by using the tools repeatedly until the mental model clicks
   - Unlike Google, the cost of NOT developing this literacy is much higher

## Part 2: From Chatting to Labor

**Core Message**: The shift from AI as advisor to AI as worker. This changes everything.

### Slides

1. **Title: From Chatting to Labor**
   - Mood: Transitional, building

2. **Chatbots as Knowledgeable Friends**
   - Asking questions, getting explanations, brainstorming, summarizing
   - Powerful — but still advisory

3. **The Shift**
   - When AI is given tools, skills, and the ability to act
   - Stops being Advice → Starts becoming Labor

4. **The New Stack**
   - Agents, Skills, Tools, Execution loops

5. **Reframing**
   - One chatbot = One helpful friend
   - Agents + tools = Teams of digital employees

6. **Key Quote**
   - "The big shift isn't better answers. It's getting work done from a knowledgeable perspective."

## Part 3: Why Mapping the Journey Matters

**Core Message**: Confusion is a sequencing problem, not an intelligence problem. The map helps you know where you are and what's next.

### Slides

1. **Title: Why Mapping the Journey Matters**
   - Mood: Empathetic, clarifying

2. **The Current Reality**
   - Overwhelming amount of information
   - Everyone teaches from a different level
   - Context is rarely stated

3. **What Happens**
   - People skip steps
   - Everything feels hard
   - Nothing feels coherent
   - "This is too complex — I'm out."

4. **Key Quote**
   - "Confusion is almost always a sequencing problem, not an intelligence problem."

5. **Why the Map Exists**
   - To help you know where you are
   - To understand what's next
   - To give you permission to ignore everything else

## Part 4: The Map Itself

**Core Message**: This is about depth of engagement, not identity. None of this is inherently hard.

### Slides

1. **Title: The Map Itself - Depth, Not Identity**
   - Mood: Clarifying, inclusive

2. **Important Clarification**
   - This is NOT: Technical vs non-technical people, Smart vs not smart
   - This IS: Different depths of engagement, Different willingness to go further

3. **The Real Divider**
   - None of this is inherently hard
   - The real divider is willingness to ask questions about things you don't yet understand

## Part 5: Non-Technical Track (Levels 0-8)

**Core Message**: Deep AI capability without writing code. Levels of progression for non-programmers.

### Slides

1. **Title: Depth Without Coding (Levels 0-8)**
   - Track header: Non-Technical Track

2. **Level 0: Avoidance** - "This won't affect my job."
3. **Level 1: AI as Enhanced Google** - Q&A, summaries, explanations, brainstorming
4. **Level 2: AI as Thought Partner** - Thinking out loud, writing assistance, reflection
5. **Level 3: Context Engineering** - Structuring inputs, using Projects, choosing models
6. **Level 4: Capture & Learning** - Voice dictation, meeting notes, AI tutoring
7. **Level 5: AI-Enabled Browsing** - Browser AI layers, research without breaking flow
8. **Level 6: Media & Creative Production** - Image generation, iterative refinement
9. **Level 7: No-Code Automations** - Workflow tools (n8n, Gum Loop)
10. **Level 8: Natural-Language Software** - Lovable, Bolt, AI Studio

## Part 6: Technical Track (Levels 1-9)

**Core Message**: Building compounding power through coding tools. Levels of progression for programmers.

### Slides

1. **Title: Agency & Compounding Power (Levels 1-9)**
   - Track header: Technical Track

2. **Level 1: Command Line Basics** - Navigating folders, running commands
3. **Level 2: Version Control** - GitHub as the Dropbox of code
4. **Level 3: AI-Native IDEs** - Cursor, Composer, inline edits
5. **Level 4: Multi-Mode Workflows** - Planning, execution, review modes
6. **Level 5: Full Software Lifecycle** - Deployment, databases, MCP servers
7. **Level 6: Customizing the Harness** - Custom agents, Skills, plugins
8. **Level 7: Context & Session Management** - Multiple terminals, memory management
9. **Level 8: Parallel Agents** - Multiple sub-agents, explicit memory systems
10. **Level 9: Swarms & Infrastructure** - Large agent deployments, cloud execution

## Extension: Managing Input Overload

**Core Message**: Using AI to manage cognitive load from digital inputs.

### Slides

1. **Title: Managing Input Overload**
2. **After Creative & Media Use** - Using AI to manage email, Slack, docs, notifications
3. **AI for Cognitive Load** - Summarize, prioritize, draft, reduce noise

## Part 7: Examples

**Core Message**: Your existing data is dormant intelligence waiting to be activated.

### Slides

1. **Title: Examples - Dormant Intelligence**
2. **Notes Example** - Years of Apple Notes → Exported to Markdown → Became searchable and alive
3. **Recipes Example** - Personal cooking history → Cleaned, structured, reusable
4. **Key Quote** - "This isn't new data. It's dormant intelligence."

## Closing

**Core Message**: You're not behind - you're somewhere on the map. Learn the next step and ignore the rest.

### Slides

1. **Title: Where You Are on the Map**
2. **You don't become good at this by watching**
   - By using it, by struggling, by internalizing a mental model

3. **The Difference**
   - "This time, the stakes are much higher."

4. **You are not behind**
   - You are just somewhere on the map
   - Learn the next step — and ignore the rest for now

5. **Thank You / Questions**
