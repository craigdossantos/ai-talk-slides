We grew up with Google as part of our world, became accustomed to using it. Now AI tech is powerful enough that the gulf between tech-literate and non-tech-literate people is widening significantly. This literacy gap changes what you're able to do in your job.

The most important thing: think about it from a mental model perspective first.

Common worry: "AI will take your job." Some jobs will go away, but more importantly: there will be a separation between people who use AI and people who don't. Same pattern as previous tech divides (computers, internet, Google). This gulf may be much larger than previous ones.

Near-term reality: Less about AI taking your job → More about someone using AI getting hired instead of you.`,

With experience, you learn: Google knows where you are, it will use Google Maps automatically, you adapt your input to what the technology needs.

          talkingPoints: `To update mental models: understand what's possible and how to think at that level. Partly through using tools, partly through understanding the landscape.

Helpful to map out the journey so far and where it's going.

Challenge: overwhelming amount of information out there. People talk at their own level of understanding. Context often unstated (technical, basic, non-technical but advanced).

Problem with skipping steps: Tried to jump straight to bleeding edge, nothing feels coherent, gets too complex.

Requires a progressive approach for tech this powerful, novel, and fast-changing.

Key insight: Confusion about what to learn next is a sequencing problem, not an identity problem. Not "this isn't me because I'm not a developer."

We now have the greatest learning tool ever. Can ask anything without embarrassment. No judgment for not knowing prerequisites. "I ask questions I wouldn't ask a human because it would be embarrassing to admit I don't know."`,

Historical pattern: Technology treated as a black box, people who understand it protect that knowledge as valuable, explain things in hand-wavy ways to "non-technical" people.

What's changed: The floor of what you can do without ever looking at code is now incredibly high. Used to be binary: can you code or not? Now lines are blurring. Learn anything by talking to a chat model. Get AI to do the parts you don't want to do yourself.

The real question: How much resistance to change do you feel? Are you willing to adopt foreign technology? Can you push through discomfort to get to the other side? Or do you resist when things change?

Structured input → better results. Example: Give Markdown instead of PDF. Learning Markdown takes about an hour.

Being explicit about desired output type.

Using Projects (Claude, ChatGPT feature): Gives AI more context per conversation on same topic. Important: Chat interfaces don't show you when context is full. Unlike coding tools (Claude Code) that show context usage. Desktop Claude/ChatGPT won't warn you when memory is degrading. Solution: Use projects explicitly for different topics. Keeps conversations focused, context cleaner.

Choosing the right model: Within Anthropic/Claude: different models for different tasks. Some good at thinking long and hard. Some faster. Some better at iteration.

This is where results start feeling reliable instead of shooting in the dark. Requires understanding what makes input/output better and what "performance" looks like.`,

Claude Chrome extension: Can take actions just like you in the browser, look through sites, upload, download. Anything you can do in browser, it can theoretically do.

Important shift: Not just outputting media or text. Real workflow automation. Using tools to do work vs. getting information or creating assets.`,

Tools: Lovable, Bolt AI, Google AI Studio (free, easiest place to start).

Great for showing you can use AI to create software easily.

Good introduction to the limits: Currently mostly front-end stuff. Start understanding front-end vs. back-end difference. Great at creating things that look good. Limitations: user sign-in, session data, databases, back-end functionality.

Key insight: You don't need to know code syntax to make something semi-functional.

Important reframe: Still using natural language as the interface. AI does the technical work — you direct it with words.

Key difference from chat interfaces: Browser/desktop apps don't have full access. Like how Gmail doesn't know what's on your desktop.

Command line = the underpinnings of everything on your computer. Before graphical interfaces (Windows, Mac OS), there was command line. Text-based access to everything on your machine. Works perfectly with language models.

GitHub = Dropbox for code. Store your codebases in the cloud. Share with the world. Pull in other people's work.

Learning note: Git is more complicated than it first appears. Initially seems simple: save, name, branch, merge back. Actually has fair amount of complexity. Worth taking time to understand properly. Incomplete understanding causes problems later (learned this the hard way).

Cursor: Very popular option. ChatGPT-style chat window on one side. Code files and documents on the other side. Friendly chat interface, not command line.

Learning recommendation: Don't just press buttons — learn as the AI does it. Have it explain what it's doing, especially when errors happen.

Same applies to AI — this is called tuning your harness.

Components you can customize: Skills: Markdown files that say "this skill is available." AI loads skills only when needed (like Neo in The Matrix). Prevents context overload.

Slash commands: Shortcuts in your CLI. Instead of repeating instructions, just /review triggers a whole process.

Sub-agents: Mini-versions of the AI. Spin off to do specific tasks in separate context windows. Come back with results.

Guidance files (agent.md, claude.md): Overarching instructions for every prompt. Like a system prompt for the agent.

The goal: Get that lump of context as tuned as possible.

The problem: Too bloated → not enough memory for AI to understand it all. Starts to forget things, like short-term memory overflow. Models get dumber the more full their memory gets.

Session management challenge: New session = no context from previous session. Like the guy in Memento with amnesia.

Solutions for persistent memory: Write to markdown files (file system memory). Write to a SQL database. Many approaches exist.

Multiple terminals per project: Can have different sessions focused on different aspects. Each terminal = separate context window. Useful for compartmentalizing work.

The mental model loop: Use the tools → modify how you think it works → try again. Your understanding gets richer, more accurate, more potential. Only happens through doing.
