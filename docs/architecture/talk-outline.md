### Slide 1: The Widening Gulf of Technology

**Talking Points:**

- Technology has always made us more efficient as its main function
- Examples of efficiency gains:
  - Bicycle → travel faster
  - Typewriter/printing press → push communications farther
  - Google → access to information
- We grew up with Google as part of our world, became accustomed to using it
- Now AI tech is powerful enough that the gulf between tech-literate and non-tech-literate people is widening significantly
- This literacy gap changes what you're able to do in your job
- Common worry: "AI will take your job"
- Some jobs will go away, but more importantly: there will be a separation between people who use AI and people who don't
- Same pattern as previous tech divides (computers, internet, Google)
- This gulf may be much larger than previous ones

**Bullet Points:**

- Technology gives us speed and capabilities: fire, bicycles, cars, Internet
- AI might create a larger gulf than previous tech
- People with AI tools will outperform people without

**Visual:**
A picture of a gulf that's thin at the bottom, with layers showing fire, bicycles, the Internet at lower levels, and AI at the top pushing the gulf apart. Each progressive technology spreads the gulf wider. Remove the yellow text box. Title: "The Widening Gulf of Technology"

### Slide 2: Mental Models Through Use

**Talking Points:**

- Mental models are the first place to start
- We already use mental models to understand technology
- Example: Finding directions to an ice cream store
  - Less experienced user: "Please give me directions to the nearest ice cream store, which is called Molly Moon"
  - Experienced user: "Directions to Molly Moon Google Maps"
- With experience, you learn:
  - Google knows where you are
  - It will use Google Maps automatically
  - You adapt your input to what the technology needs
- Key insight: This understanding didn't come from a course or reading about Google
- It comes through **use, not instruction**
- Exposure → see output → adjust input → see what works
- The more you use a tool, the better you get

**Bullet Points:**

- Mental models improve more through use, not instruction

**Visual:**
Title: "Mental Models Through Use" - Remove verbose search and confident action text, keep it simple.

---

### Slide 3: New Tech, Old Mental Model

**Talking Points:**

- Tempting to use the same mental model with new technology
- First instinct with ChatGPT: treat it as a better version of Google
- Google finds anything on the internet → ChatGPT is an expert in anything on the internet
- You use it like a friend:
  - Back and forth conversation
  - Knows the entire corpus of internet knowledge
  - Can reason across domains (somewhat)
- But it's inconsistent:
  - Sometimes really smart
  - Sometimes gives wrong information (hallucinations)
  - Not always reliable

**Bullet Points:**

- Mental Model: ChatGPT as a better Google
- It has different flaws: hallucinations

**Visual:**
Title: "New Tech, Old Mental Model" - Less busy, remove the yellow metaphorical visualization. Can have a hallucination visualization (like dripping clocks). Remove "Brilliant" text that doesn't make sense.

### Slide 4: From Savant to Digital Employee

**Talking Points:**

- Major mental leap: AI is not just an all-knowing friend
- Think of it as a **digital employee**
- Can do anything you can do on your computer (most knowledge work)
- Shift from:
  - Getting advice/information in a chat interface
  - To: actual **execution**
- You become a director/orchestrator
  - Making decisions
  - Coordinating
- Key difference: You don't have just one digital employee
- You can have as many as you can handle

**Bullet Points:**

- AI is not an all-knowing savant with advice
- It's a digital employee who can execute work
- You can become a team lead

**Visual:**
Title: "From Savant to Digital Employee" - Less busy background, keep the foreground clear to see what's happening.

---

### Slide 5: Mapping the Journey

**Talking Points:**

- To update mental models: understand what's possible and how to think at that level
- Partly through using tools, partly through understanding the landscape
- Helpful to map out the journey so far and where it's going
- Challenge: overwhelming amount of information out there
  - People talk at their own level of understanding
  - Context often unstated (technical, basic, non-technical but advanced)
- Problem with skipping steps:
  - Tried to jump straight to bleeding edge
  - Nothing feels coherent
  - Gets too complex
- Requires a **progressive approach** for tech this powerful, novel, and fast-changing
- Key insight: Confusion about what to learn next is a **sequencing problem**, not an identity problem
  - Not "this isn't me because I'm not a developer"
- We now have the greatest learning tool ever
  - Can ask anything without embarrassment
  - No judgment for not knowing prerequisites
  - "I ask questions I wouldn't ask a human because it would be embarrassing to admit I don't know"

**Bullet Points:**

- Overwhelming amount of information
- Skipping steps makes nothing feel coherent
- Feeling confused is a sequencing problem, not a capability
- We have the greatest self learning tool ever

**Visual:**
Much less busy. Ada should be holding a flowchart that closely resembles the actual React site we're building, and that flowchart should be much larger and more prominent in the picture.

---

### Slide 6: What It Takes

**Talking Points:**

- Tempting to split by identity: "technical person" vs "non-technical person"
- This is the wrong split — it's mostly a **cultural issue**
- Historical pattern:
  - Technology treated as a black box
  - People who understand it protect that knowledge as valuable
  - Explain things in hand-wavy ways to "non-technical" people
- What's changed:
  - The floor of what you can do **without ever looking at code** is now incredibly high
  - Used to be binary: can you code or not?
  - Now lines are blurring
  - Learn anything by talking to a chat model
  - Get AI to do the parts you don't want to do yourself
- The real question:
  - How much **resistance to change** do you feel?
  - Are you willing to adopt foreign technology?
  - Can you push through discomfort to get to the other side?
  - Or do you resist when things change?
- **This** is the real gulf — not technical vs non-technical

**Bullet Points:**

- What does it mean to be "technical"
- Resistance to change is the only barrier to entry

**Visual:**
Title: "What It Takes" - Ada leaping over the Gulf of Technology. AI is in the gulf. She's breaking through restraints/ropes as she jumps - those represent resistance to change. Remove the technical/non-technical and cultural/non-inherent labels from the sides.

---

### Slide 7: Avoidance (Level 0)

**Talking Points:**

- Level zero is **avoidance**
- "This won't affect my job"
- Historical echoes: famous people dismissing transformative tech
- Some people are afraid AI will take away our ability to think
- I think that could be true for some.. but what's possible is that it pushes you to think bigger, and at a higher level

**Bullet Points:**

- Avoidance is just fear showing its head
- AI may require us to think at a higher level

**Visual:**
Remove the level badge (and from all following slides). Keep the head in the sand visual. Add two quotes:

1. "I think there is a world market for maybe five computers." - Thomas Watson, IBM, 1943
2. "I see little commercial potential for the internet for the next 10 years" - Bill Gates, early 90s

---

### Slide 8: AI = Portal to Internet Research (Level 1)

**Talking Points:**

- Using AI for:
  - Question and answers
  - Summaries
  - Explanations
  - Brainstorming
- Includes prompt engineering
- Built-in prompt improvement tools:
  - Start with messy natural language
  - Let the system clean it up
- This is where most daily ChatGPT users start

**Bullet Points:**

- Use AI for Q&A, summaries and explanations, brainstorming
- Learn prompt engineering basics
- Where most daily ChatGPT users are

**Visual:**
Title: "AI = Portal to Internet Research" - Remove level 1. Less busy, keep the Google turning into ChatGPT transformation. Remove the confusing box at the bottom with messy question stuff. Can add something about "prompt engineering" if it fits cleanly.

---

### Slide 9: AI as Thought Partner (Level 2)

**Talking Points:**

- Giving AI more context: PDFs, docs, images
- Having it read through things, then go back and forth
- Beyond what you'd use enhanced Google for
- Use AI as a thought partner, to explore ideas
- Physical or mental health questions that require back and forth
- Also at this level: trying different models
  - ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude
  - Like talking to three different types of people
  - Each has strengths and weaknesses
- Example: Gemini (by Google) can natively take in YouTube videos, Google Docs
- Technologies integrated within same company ecosystem

**Bullet Points:**

- Giving AI more context: PDFs, docs, images
- Back and forth dialogue on complex topics like health
- Trying different models: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude

**Visual:**

1. Remove level 2
2. Title: "AI as Thought Partner"
3. Remove the box at the bottom
4. Less busy background
5. More like she's having a conversation with an AI
6. The AI might be like an AI doctor for example

**Connected Slides:**
Three connected slides branching off, each with a screenshot:

- ChatGPT
- Google Gemini
- Anthropic Claude

---

### Slide 10: Context Engineering (Level 3)

**Talking Points:**

- Understanding how context helps or hurts
- Mental model shift required:
  - Longer chat window = more memory used up
  - Like holding too much in short-term memory
  - Performance and quality degrade as memory fills
- Structured input → better results
  - Example: Give Markdown instead of PDF
  - Learning Markdown takes about an hour
- Being explicit about desired output type
- Using Projects (Claude, ChatGPT feature):
  - Gives AI more context per conversation on same topic
  - Important: Chat interfaces don't show you when context is full
  - Unlike coding tools (Claude Code) that show context usage
  - Desktop Claude/ChatGPT won't warn you when memory is degrading
  - Solution: Use projects explicitly for different topics
  - Keeps conversations focused, context cleaner
- Choosing the right model:
  - Within Anthropic/Claude: different models for different tasks
  - Some good at thinking long and hard
  - Some faster
  - Some better at iteration
- This is where results start feeling **reliable** instead of shooting in the dark
- Requires understanding what makes input/output better and what "performance" looks like

**Bullet Points:**

- Understanding how context works
- Structured input (Markdown) yields better results
- Using Projects to manage context
- Results start feeling reliable

**Visual:**
Title: "Context Engineering" - Remove the level. I like the idea of her putting tokens into a big memory bank/basket, and that basket has holes in the side, so when it gets too full of tokens, the tokens are spilling out.

**Resources:**

- https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
- A page about using projects with Claude and GPT etc.

### Slide 11: Using AI Tools (Level 4)

**Talking Points:**

- Starting to use AI-adjacent tools in daily workflow
- Examples:
  - **Wispr Flow** — voice dictation (this talk was created using it)
  - **Granola** — automatic meeting notes
  - Many other tools people are using
- Personal example: Apple Notes → Obsidian
  - Similar tool but keeps everything in Markdown
  - AI can now look at all notes comprehensively
  - Can do things with notes that were impossible in Apple Notes (walled garden)
- Key shift: Making your data accessible and usable by AI
- Other tools with AI functionality:
  - Figma
  - Canva
  - Notion
  - Slack

**Bullet Points:**

- Use AI tools:
  - Wispr Flow - voice dictation
  - Granola - automatic meeting notes
  - Obsidian - AI-accessible notes in Markdown
  - Figma, Canva, Notion, Slack with AI features
- Integrate AI into your workflows

**Visual:**
Title: "Using AI Tools" - Remove level 4. Keep the original icons. Use same style icon for Wispr Flow or a mic. Less busy background (currently looks like a dollar bill).

**Resources:**

- Links to Wispr and Granola

---

### Slide 12: AI-Powered Browsing (Level 5)

**Talking Points:**

- AI tools integrated with your browser
- **Google Gemini** built into Chrome:
  - Can look at whatever tab you're on
  - Start a conversation right there in the tab
  - Super useful for learning
- **ChatGPT's Operator browser (Atlas)**:
  - Everything typed goes to ChatGPT instead of Google
  - ChatGPT understands everything you're browsing (more context)
  - Interesting but underwhelming as a browser (Chrome more functional)
- **Claude Chrome extension**:
  - Can take actions just like you in the browser
  - Look through sites, upload, download
  - Anything you can do in browser, it can theoretically do
- Security considerations:
  - Something looking at your browser = potential risks
  - Be careful with financial sites, sensitive data
  - But: don't let fear of what could go wrong stop you from figuring out what's possible

**Bullet Points:**

- Browsers are the modern workbench
- How customized is yours?
- Google Gemini built into Chrome
- ChatGPT Operator (Atlas) browser
- Claude extension - takes actions in browser

**Visual:**
Title: "AI-Powered Browsing" - Remove level 5. Less dark. Focus on these three tools:

1. Claude extension
2. ChatGPT Atlas browser
3. Highlight the Gemini top right corner - make it very visible where people can find it in their Chrome browser

**Resources:**
Links to all the browser tools

### Slide 13: Creating Media with AI (Level 6)

**Talking Points:**

- Creating media with AI
- Image generation:
  - Nano Banana (Gemini/Google) — best image tool currently
  - Midjourney
- Video/media production: Veo, O3
- The skill here: Can you get it to give you what you want?
  - "I have this specific idea..."
- Haven't spent much time here personally, but lots of potential
- Future opportunity: Creating a **harness** for media production
  - Higher fidelity than one-shotting everything
  - (Will discuss harnesses later)

**Bullet Points:**

- Image generation: Nano Banana, Midjourney, ChatGPT
- Video production: Veo3
- The skill is can you get it to give you what you want?

**Visual:**
Title: "Creating Media with AI" - Remove the level. Show basic example images from Nano Banana, Midjourney, and ChatGPT with their icons.

**Connected Slides:**
Slides with images/screenshots of how the slides for this presentation were created.

### Slide 14: AI for Automation (Level 7)

**Talking Points:**

- Using AI for automation
- Even non-technical people can do this easily without learning much
- May not have dug in deeply yet
- Tools:
  - **Zapier** — most common, but not AI-centric
  - **N8n** — bridge from Zapier to more complex automations
  - **Gumloop** — built specifically with AI in mind
- These are visual interfaces to doing things with code
  - Don't actually have to look at code much
  - What you do see can be created by an AI model
- Important shift: Not just outputting media or text
  - Real **workflow automation**
  - Using tools to **do work** vs. getting information or creating assets

**Bullet Points:**

- Zapier - most common automation tool
- N8n - bridge to complex automations
- Gumloop - built with AI in mind
- Visual interfaces to doing things with code - without looking at code

**Visual:**
Title: "AI for Automation" - Remove the level. Show something that looks like an N8n interface. Look at a picture of an N8n automation and create a version of that in the background instead of the machine.

---

### Slide 15: Natural Language Software Tools (Level 8)

**Talking Points:**

- Last level of completely non-technical path
- Tools:
  - **Lovable**
  - **Bolt AI**
  - **Google AI Studio** (free, easiest place to start)
- Great for showing you can use AI to create software easily
- Good introduction to the **limits**:
  - Currently mostly front-end stuff
  - Start understanding front-end vs. back-end difference
  - Great at creating things that look good
  - Limitations: user sign-in, session data, databases, back-end functionality
- Key insight: You don't need to know code syntax to make something semi-functional
- Good playground to get comfortable with the idea

**Bullet Points:**

- Lovable, Bolt AI, Google AI Studio
- Create software without knowing code syntax
- Great playground to get comfortable with using AI for software
- Understanding the limits is part of the learning

**Visual:**
Title: "Natural Language Software Tools" - Remove level 8. Keep Google AI Studio, Lovable, and Bolt brands. Less dark background. Show Ada turning language into software as a visualization.

---

### Slide 16: Command Line Interface (CLI)

**Talking Points:**

- Moving into what might be called the "technical track"
- Important reframe: Still using natural language as the interface
- AI does the technical work — you direct it with words
- Key difference from chat interfaces:
  - Browser/desktop apps don't have full access
  - Like how Gmail doesn't know what's on your desktop
- Command line = the underpinnings of everything on your computer
  - Before graphical interfaces (Windows, Mac OS), there was command line
  - Text-based access to everything on your machine
  - Works perfectly with language models
- The shift: AI now has full access to whatever you give it access to on your computer
- CLI = Command Line Interface
- First step: Learn basic navigation commands (cd, ls, pwd)
- Commands differ slightly between Mac and PC
- Get comfortable with this text-based interface

**Bullet Points:**

- Still using natural language as the interface
- Command line = text-based access to everything on your machine
- Learn command line basics - cd, ls, pwd

**Visual:**
Title: "Command Line Interface (CLI)" - The command line prompt should be fairly prominent. It should look like the CLI is a portal to the rest of the computer. Make it bigger and clearer that the portal is a command line.

**Resources:**

- How to install Claude Code
- How to install Codex
- How to install Gemini CLI

**Connected Slide:**
Screenshot of typing "claude" and getting the Claude prompt.

### Slide 18: Using Git and GitHub (Level 2 Technical)

**Talking Points:**

- Git = versioning system for code
  - Like version history in Google Docs, but for code
  - Take snapshots of your codebase
  - Rewind to previous states if something breaks
  - Merge work from multiple people on the same project
- Why it matters now:
  - When AI is writing code, mistakes happen
  - Need ability to go back to working versions
  - Essential safety net for experimentation
- GitHub = Dropbox for code
  - Store your codebases in the cloud
  - Share with the world
  - Pull in other people's work
- Learning note:
  - Git is more complicated than it first appears
  - Initially seems simple: save, name, branch, merge back
  - Actually has fair amount of complexity
  - Worth taking time to understand properly
  - Incomplete understanding causes problems later (learned this the hard way)
- Can have AI teach you, watch YouTube videos
- Important foundation before going deeper

**Bullet Points:**

- Git = versioning system (like Google Docs history, but for code)
- Take snapshots, rewind, merge work from multiple people
- GitHub = Dropbox for code (store, share, collaborate)
- Essential safety net when AI makes mistakes
- Worth taking time to understand properly

**Visual:**
Title: "Using Git and GitHub" - Big GitHub logo as one of the prominent elements on the page.

---

### Slide 19: Agents and AI Coding (Level 3 Technical)

**Talking Points:**

- IDE = Integrated Development Environment
  - Like Word or Google Docs, but for code
  - Interface for writing and managing code files
  - Additional features: run code, test code, scripts, GitHub integration
- You don't _have_ to use an IDE (can use just command line)
  - But eventually you'll want to see what the AI is doing
  - IDE gives you visibility into the work
- **Google's Anti-Gravity**:
  - Easiest place to start
  - Can create full applications
  - Has a window just for managing the agents writing code
  - You can literally never look at the code if you don't want to
- **Cursor**:
  - Very popular option
  - ChatGPT-style chat window on one side
  - Code files and documents on the other side
  - Friendly chat interface, not command line
- Key concept: Inline execution
  - Instructions and results live on the same surface
  - Fast feedback loop
  - AI can see where code is going and what happens
  - Creates a continuous improvement loop
  - Agent writes → sees result → adjusts → improves

**Bullet Points:**

- IDE = Integrated Development Environment
- Google's Anti-Gravity - easiest place to start
- Cursor = chat window + code editor side by side
- Inline execution: fast feedback loop
- Agent writes → sees result → adjusts → improves

**Visual:**
Title: "Agents and AI Coding" - Show symbols/logos for Anti-Gravity, Cursor, and VSCode.

---

### Slide 20: Modes and Workflows (Level 4 Technical)

**Talking Points:**

- Moving beyond back-and-forth chat conversation
- Now creating distinct steps, using the model in different ways
- The workflow:
  - **Plan**: Create a PRD (Product Requirements Document), scope the full project
  - **Build**: Model builds based on the requirements doc
  - **Test**: Verify what was built works
  - **Review**: Code review, quality check
  - **Deploy**: Ship it
  - **Bug fix**: Address issues
  - **Plan again**: Cycle continues
- What's happening:
  - You're executing an actual software development lifecycle
  - Instead of a team, you're using one model in different modes
  - Model shape-shifts depending on the step
- Learning curve:
  - Helps to understand how software is actually built
  - Continuously refine your process as you learn
  - Easy to start, progressively deepen with AI teaching you
- Key shift: Structured workflow vs. freeform conversation

**Bullet Points:**

- Plan → Build → Test → Review → Deploy → Bug Fix → Plan
- One model in different modes for each step
- Model shape-shifts depending on the task
- You're executing an actual software development lifecycle
- Structured workflow vs. freeform conversation

**Visual:**
_(No specific visual feedback provided - maintain current style)_

---

### Slide 21: Full Software Lifecycle (Level 5 Technical)

**Talking Points:**

- Now handling the complete picture:
  - Deployment
  - Databases (saving data on backend)
  - Hosting
  - Domains and DNS
- Popular tools:
  - **Supabase** — databases
  - **Vercel** — hosting and deployment
  - **Cloudflare** — hosting, domains, DNS
- AI-assisted deployment:
  - MCP servers or CLI tools can do setup and deployment for you
  - Huge level-up if you've never deployed before
  - Easy to get lost in settings without this help
- Learning recommendation:
  - Don't just press buttons — learn as the AI does it
  - Have it explain what it's doing, especially when errors happen
  - Look at the interfaces even if you're not directly touching them
  - Build a general idea of what's happening
  - Over time, repeated exposure → better understanding
- This is where things go live and reach real users

**Bullet Points:**

- Supabase — databases
- Vercel — hosting and deployment
- Cloudflare — domains and DNS
- AI-assisted deployment: MCP servers or CLI tools
- Learn as the AI does it — don't just press buttons

---

### Slide 22: Customizing the Harness (Level 6 Technical)

**Talking Points:**

- At this point, AI is not just a chatbot with turn-based responses
- It's an **agent**: chatting with itself, thinking, iterating
  - Loop: do something → look at result → do something else → come back to you
- Analogy to delegating to a real person:
  - Give custom instructions
  - Educate them on skills
  - Provide reference materials ("here's work done before")
- Same applies to AI — this is called **tuning your harness**
- Components you can customize:
  - **Skills**: Markdown files that say "this skill is available"
    - AI loads skills only when needed (like Neo in The Matrix)
    - Prevents context overload
  - **Slash commands**: Shortcuts in your CLI
    - Instead of repeating instructions, just `/review` triggers a whole process
  - **Sub-agents**: Mini-versions of the AI
    - Spin off to do specific tasks in separate context windows
    - Come back with results
  - **Guidance files** (agent.md, claude.md):
    - Overarching instructions for every prompt
    - Like a system prompt for the agent
  - **Hooks**: Trigger actions based on events

**Bullet Points:**

- Skills: Markdown files loaded when needed (like Neo in The Matrix)
- Slash commands: shortcuts instead of repeating instructions
- Sub-agents: mini-versions doing tasks in separate contexts
- Guidance files (claude.md): system prompts for every interaction
- Hooks: trigger actions based on events

---

### Slide 23: Context Management (Level 7 Technical)

**Talking Points:**

- Context engineering was earlier — this goes deeper
- Context = everything you hand over alongside your specific instruction
- The problem:
  - Too bloated → not enough memory for AI to understand it all
  - Starts to forget things, like short-term memory overflow
  - Models get dumber the more full their memory gets
- Session management challenge:
  - New session = no context from previous session
  - Like the guy in Memento with amnesia
- Solutions for persistent memory:
  - Write to markdown files (file system memory)
  - Write to a SQL database
- Key skill: Knowing when to reset your session

**Bullet Points:**

- Context = everything you hand over with your instruction
- Too bloated → model forgets things, quality degrades
- New session = no context (like Memento amnesia)
- Solutions: write to files, databases, or start fresh
- Key skill: knowing when to reset your session

---

### Slide 24: Parallel Agents (Level 8 Technical)

**Talking Points:**

- Using multiple sub-agents and multiple sessions simultaneously
- New challenges:
  - Managing context and memory across agents
  - Code checkout strategies
  - Avoiding collisions
- Tools for parallel work:
  - **GitHub Worktrees**: Separate working directories for same repo
  - **Conductor.build**: Popular tool that uses GitHub Worktrees
  - **Beads**: Memory/context management across sessions
- Sub-agent strategy:
  - Spin up agent to do a task
  - Comes back with just the answer, not all their work
  - Prevents filling up your context with their process
- This is orchestration at scale

**Bullet Points:**

- Multiple sub-agents and sessions simultaneously
- GitHub Worktrees: separate working directories
- Conductor.build, Beads: tools for parallel work
- Sub-agents return answers, not their full process
- You're coordinating, not executing

---

### Slide 25: Swarms and Infrastructure (Level 9 Technical)

**Talking Points:**

- The edge of what's possible right now
- Large numbers of agents running simultaneously
- Tools like **Ralph Wiggum**:
  - Spin up agents in serial, over and over
  - Let it run overnight
- Token usage at this level:
  - Using tons of tokens
  - Need the $100-$200/month plan or more
- Beyond your local machine:
  - Virtual Private Server (VPS)
  - Agents running in the cloud 24/7
- Where the infrastructure meets the intelligence

**Bullet Points:**

- Large numbers of agents running simultaneously
- Ralph Wiggum: spin up agents in serial overnight
- Token usage at this level: $100-200+/month plans
- Virtual Private Servers: agents running in the cloud 24/7
- Where infrastructure meets intelligence

---

### Slide 26: The Only Way Forward Is Through (Closing)

**Talking Points:**

- The real solution: become good at it by using it
- The superpower: Ask the models to teach you
  - No embarrassment about not knowing
  - Just ask progressively simpler questions until you understand
- The mental model loop:
  - Use the tools → modify how you think it works → try again
  - Your understanding gets richer, more accurate
- Good news: It's changing so fast, you're not behind if you start now
- The danger: Putting it on the shelf for a couple years
- Even if you think this doesn't apply to you — someone using this learns faster

**Bullet Points:**

- Ask the models to teach you — no embarrassment about not knowing
- Use tools → modify how you think → try again → richer understanding
- It's changing so fast, you're not behind if you start now
- The danger: putting it on the shelf for a couple years
- Even if you think this doesn't apply to you — someone using this learns faster
