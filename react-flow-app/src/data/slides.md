# Original Talk Outline Reference

Below is the original talk outline for reference when editing content.

## Part 1: Mental Models, Not Magic

**Core Message**: This talk is about mental models for AI, not specific tools. Understanding HOW to think about AI matters more than which app to use.

- Title: Mental Models, Not Magic
- This talk is not about tools - it's about mental models
- The Google Analogy - Getting "good at Google" was about internalizing a mental model
- Learning to Think Like Google
  - What you first tried: "Please give me directions to the nearest ice cream store which is called Molly Moon."
  - What you learned: `Molly Moon directions Google Maps`
- Chatbots: The Next Step - ChatGPT and Claude are like a savant friend
- The Real Leap: Execution - You are no longer talking to a friend, you are directing digital employees
- At Scale - You become a top-level director
- The Expanded Mental Model - "I now have access to the world's corpus of knowledge AND the ability to make things digitally."
- Key Insight - Understanding only arrives by using the tools repeatedly until the mental model clicks

## Part 2: From Chatting to Labor

**Core Message**: The shift from AI as advisor to AI as worker. This changes everything.

- Chatbots as Knowledgeable Friends - Asking questions, getting explanations, brainstorming, summarizing
- The Shift - When AI is given tools, skills, and the ability to act
- The New Stack - Agents, Skills, Tools, Execution loops
- Reframing - One chatbot = One helpful friend, Agents + tools = Teams of digital employees
- Key Quote - "The big shift isn't better answers. It's getting work done from a knowledgeable perspective."

## Part 3: Why Mapping the Journey Matters

**Core Message**: Confusion is a sequencing problem, not an intelligence problem.

- The Current Reality - Overwhelming amount of information, everyone teaches from a different level
- What Happens - People skip steps, everything feels hard, nothing feels coherent
- Key Quote - "Confusion is almost always a sequencing problem, not an intelligence problem."
- Why the Map Exists - To help you know where you are and what's next

## Part 4: The Map Itself

**Core Message**: This is about depth of engagement, not identity.

- Important Clarification - NOT technical vs non-technical, IS different depths of engagement
- The Real Divider - None of this is inherently hard. The real divider is willingness to ask questions.

## Levels 0-8 (Non-Technical Track)

- **Level 0: Avoidance** - "This won't affect my job."
- **Level 1: AI as Enhanced Google** - Q&A, summaries, explanations, brainstorming
- **Level 2: AI as Thought Partner** - Thinking out loud, writing assistance, reflection
- **Level 3: Context Engineering** - Structuring inputs, using Projects, choosing models
- **Level 4: Capture & Learning** - Voice dictation, meeting notes, AI tutoring
- **Level 5: AI-Enabled Browsing** - Browser AI layers, research without breaking flow
- **Level 6: Media & Creative Production** - Image generation, iterative refinement
- **Level 7: No-Code Automations** - Workflow tools (n8n, Gum Loop)
- **Level 8: Natural-Language Software** - Lovable, Bolt, AI Studio

## Closing

**Core Message**: You're not behind - you're somewhere on the map. Learn the next step and ignore the rest.

- You don't become good at this by watching - By using it, by struggling, by internalizing a mental model
- The Difference - "This time, the stakes are much higher."
- You are not behind - You are just somewhere on the map. Learn the next step.
