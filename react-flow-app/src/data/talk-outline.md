## Slides

---

### Slide 1: Technology and the Widening Gulf

**Talking Points:**
- Technology has always made us more efficient as its main function
- Examples of efficiency gains:
  - Bicycle Ã¢â€ â€™ travel faster
  - Typewriter/printing press Ã¢â€ â€™ push communications farther
  - Google Ã¢â€ â€™ access to information
- We grew up with Google as part of our world, became accustomed to using it
- Now AI tech is powerful enough that the gulf between tech-literate and non-tech-literate people is widening significantly
- This literacy gap changes what you're able to do in your job
- The most important thing: think about it from a **mental model perspective** first

**Visual Suggestion:**
Progression of images showing:
1. Bicycle
2. Computer
3. Google home screen

Each with labels/designations showing what that technology enables (speed, communication reach, information access)

**Additional Point (connects to Slide 2):**
- Common worry: "AI will take your job"
- Some jobs will go away, but more importantly: there will be a separation between people who use AI and people who don't
- Same pattern as previous tech divides (computers, internet, Google)
- This gulf may be **much larger** than previous ones
- Near-term reality: Less about AI taking your job Ã¢â€ â€™ More about **someone using AI getting hired instead of you**

---

### Slide 2: Mental Models Through Use

**Talking Points:**
- We already use mental models to understand technology
- Example: Finding directions to an ice cream store
  - Less experienced user: "Please give me directions to the nearest ice cream store, which is called Molly Moon"
  - Experienced user: "Directions to Molly Moon Google Maps"
- With experience, you learn:
  - Google knows where you are
  - It will use Google Maps automatically
  - You adapt your input to what the technology needs
- Key insight: This understanding didn't come from a course or reading about Google
- It comes through **use, not instruction**
- Exposure Ã¢â€ â€™ see output Ã¢â€ â€™ adjust input Ã¢â€ â€™ see what works
- The more you use a tool, the better you get

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Google Maps showing Molly Moon ice cream shop in Seattle
- Split image: 
  - Left: Older person pecking at keyboard with one finger (struggling)
  - Right: Younger person confidently using Google efficiently

---

### Slide 3: New Tech, Old Mental Models

**Talking Points:**
- Tempting to use the same mental model with new technology
- First instinct with ChatGPT: treat it as a better version of Google
- Google finds anything on the internet Ã¢â€ â€™ ChatGPT is an expert in anything on the internet
- You use it like a friend:
  - Back and forth conversation
  - Knows the entire corpus of internet knowledge
  - Can reason across domains (somewhat)
- But it's inconsistent:
  - Sometimes really smart
  - Sometimes gives wrong information (hallucinations)
  - Not always reliable

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Google logo morphing/transitioning into ChatGPT logo
- Split or dual image showing:
  - ChatGPT giving accurate, helpful information
  - ChatGPT hallucinating/giving wrong information

---

### Slide 4: From Confidant to Digital Employee

**Talking Points:**
- Major mental leap: AI is not just an all-knowing friend
- Think of it as a **digital employee**
- Can do anything you can do on your computer (most knowledge work)
- Shift from:
  - Getting advice/information in a chat interface
  - To: actual **execution**
- You become a director/orchestrator
  - Making decisions
  - Coordinating
- Key difference: You don't have just one digital employee
- You can have as many as you can handle

**Visual Suggestion:**
Horde/swarm of humanoid figures with computer monitors for heads, each screen displaying a different task:
- Product management
- Design
- Coding
- Code review
- Testing
- Brainstorming
- Reading legal docs
- Reading news
- Reading books
- Creating media
- Creating music
- Creating articles/blogs/books

---

### Slide 5: Mapping the Journey

**Talking Points:**
- To update mental models: understand what's possible and how to think at that level
- Partly through using tools, partly through understanding the landscape
- Helpful to map out the journey so far and where it's going
- Challenge: overwhelming amount of information out there
  - People talk at their own level of understanding
  - Context often unstated (technical, basic, non-technical but advanced)
- Problem with skipping steps:
  - Tried to jump straight to bleeding edge
  - Nothing feels coherent
  - Gets too complex
- Requires a **progressive approach** for tech this powerful, novel, and fast-changing
- Key insight: Confusion about what to learn next is a **sequencing problem**, not an identity problem
  - Not "this isn't me because I'm not a developer"
- We now have the greatest learning tool ever
  - Can ask anything without embarrassment
  - No judgment for not knowing prerequisites
  - "I ask questions I wouldn't ask a human because it would be embarrassing to admit I don't know"

**Visual Suggestion:**
High-level flowchart/map showing the journey through different tracks
*(Note: Revisit this visual after completing all slides to include the full map of tracks)*

---

### Slide 6: Technical vs Non-Technical Is the Wrong Split

**Talking Points:**
- Tempting to split by identity: "technical person" vs "non-technical person"
- This is the wrong split Ã¢â‚¬â€ it's mostly a **cultural issue**
- Historical pattern:
  - Technology treated as a black box
  - People who understand it protect that knowledge as valuable
  - Explain things in hand-wavy ways to "non-technical" people
- What's changed:
  - The floor of what you can do **without ever looking at code** is now incredibly high
  - Used to be binary: can you code or not?
  - Now lines are blurring
  - Learn anything by talking to a chat model
  - Get AI to do the parts you don't want to do yourself
- The real question:
  - How much **resistance to change** do you feel?
  - Are you willing to adopt foreign technology?
  - Can you push through discomfort to get to the other side?
  - Or do you resist when things change?
- **This** is the real gulf Ã¢â‚¬â€ not technical vs non-technical

**Visual Suggestion:**
Grand Canyon-style valley/chasm image representing the divide:
- One side: Prosperous people with AI technology (thriving, advanced)
- Other side: Cavemen hitting things with flint (stuck in the past)
- Label one side with "Internet and Google"
- Label the prosperous side with "AI"

---

### Slide 7: Level 0 Ã¢â‚¬â€ Avoidance

**Talking Points:**
- Level zero is **avoidance**
- "This won't affect my job"
- Historical echoes: famous people dismissing transformative tech
  - Example: Find quotes from people like Bill Gates downplaying the internet

**Visual Suggestion:**
*(Need input on visual for this slide)*

---

### Slide 8: Level 1 Ã¢â‚¬â€ AI as Uber Google

**Talking Points:**
- Using AI for:
  - Question and answers
  - Summaries
  - Explanations
  - Brainstorming
- Includes prompt engineering
- Built-in prompt improvement tools:
  - Start with messy natural language
  - Let the system clean it up
- This is where most daily ChatGPT users start

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Google being sucked into/absorbed by ChatGPT (but smarter/enhanced)
- Diagram showing: messy sentence Ã¢â€ â€™ box labeled "AI" Ã¢â€ â€™ polished prompt comes out

---

### Slide 9: Level 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€ AI as Thought Partner

**Talking Points:**
- Giving AI more context:
  - PDFs
  - Docs
  - Images
- Having it read through things, then go back and forth
- Beyond what you'd use enhanced Google for
- Learning what's different than text-based, turn-based chat
- Also at this level: trying different models
  - ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude
  - Like talking to three different types of people
  - Each has strengths and weaknesses
  - Example: Gemini (by Google) can natively take in YouTube videos, Google Docs
  - Technologies integrated within same company ecosystem

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Mind meld imagery with ChatGPT
- Documents and images being fed into the AI
- Showing the shift from turn-based text chat to richer interaction

---

### Slide 10: Level 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€ Context Engineering

**Talking Points:**
- Understanding how context helps or hurts
- Mental model shift required:
  - Longer chat window = more memory used up
  - Like holding too much in short-term memory
  - Performance and quality degrade as memory fills
- Structured input Ã¢â€ â€™ better results
  - Example: Give Markdown instead of PDF
  - Learning Markdown takes about an hour
- Being explicit about desired output type
- Using Projects (Claude, ChatGPT feature):
  - Gives AI more context per conversation on same topic
  - Important: Chat interfaces don't show you when context is full
  - Unlike coding tools (Claude Code) that show context usage
  - Desktop Claude/ChatGPT won't warn you when memory is degrading
  - Solution: Use projects explicitly for different topics
  - Keeps conversations focused, context cleaner
- Choosing the right model:
  - Within Anthropic/Claude: different models for different tasks
  - Some good at thinking long and hard
  - Some faster
  - Some better at iteration
- This is where results start feeling **reliable** instead of shooting in the dark
- Requires understanding what makes input/output better and what "performance" looks like

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Messy input being formatted into structured, well-shaped objects going into the model
- Memory as a bucket being filled with structured input
- Bucket has holes at a certain level Ã¢â‚¬â€ once you exceed that level, things start falling/leaking out
- Shows the concept of context window limits and memory degradation

---

### Slide 11: Level 4 Ã¢â‚¬â€ Tools in Your Workflow

**Talking Points:**
- Starting to use AI-adjacent tools in daily workflow
- Examples:
  - **Wispr Flow** Ã¢â‚¬â€ voice dictation (this talk was created using it)
  - **Granola** Ã¢â‚¬â€ automatic meeting notes
  - Many other tools people are using
- Personal example: Apple Notes Ã¢â€ â€™ Obsidian
  - Similar tool but keeps everything in Markdown
  - AI can now look at all notes comprehensively
  - Can do things with notes that were impossible in Apple Notes (walled garden)
- Key shift: Making your data accessible and usable by AI
- Other tools with AI functionality:
  - Figma
  - Canva
  - Notion
  - Slack

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Icons for: Wispr Flow, Granola, Obsidian
- Additional icons: Figma, Canva, Notion, Slack
- Visual indication of "and more tools" / expandable ecosystem

---

### Slide 12: Level 5 Ã¢â‚¬â€ AI-Enabled Browsing

**Talking Points:**
- AI tools integrated with your browser
- **Google Gemini** built into Chrome:
  - Can look at whatever tab you're on
  - Start a conversation right there in the tab
  - Super useful for learning
- **ChatGPT's Operator browser (Atlas)**:
  - Everything typed goes to ChatGPT instead of Google
  - ChatGPT understands everything you're browsing (more context)
  - Interesting but underwhelming as a browser (Chrome more functional)
- **Claude Chrome extension**:
  - Can take actions just like you in the browser
  - Look through sites, upload, download
  - Anything you can do in browser, it can theoretically do
- Security considerations:
  - Something looking at your browser = potential risks
  - Be careful with financial sites, sensitive data
  - But: don't let fear of what could go wrong stop you from figuring out what's possible

**Visual Suggestion:**
Screenshots of:
- Gemini browser integration
- Claude browser extension
- Atlas browser (ChatGPT)

Either create visuals based on the product sites or clip directly from the sites themselves

---

### Slide 13: Level 6 Ã¢â‚¬â€ Media and Creative Production

**Talking Points:**
- Tools that help you create things with AI
- Image generation:
  - **Nano Banana** (Gemini/Google) Ã¢â‚¬â€ best image tool currently
  - **Midjourney**
- Video/media production:
  - **Veo**
  - **O3**
- The skill here: Can you get it to give you what you want?
  - "I have this specific idea..."
- Haven't spent much time here personally, but lots of potential
- Future opportunity: Creating a **harness** for media production
  - Higher fidelity than one-shotting everything
  - (Will discuss harnesses later)

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Crazy/impressive images from Nano Banana
- Popular/striking examples from Midjourney
- Fast-moving GIFs from Google's Veo page showing video generation examples

---

### Slide 14: Level 7 Ã¢â‚¬â€ Automation Tools

**Talking Points:**
- Even non-technical people can do this easily without learning much
- May not have dug in deeply yet
- Tools:
  - **Zapier** Ã¢â‚¬â€ most common, but not AI-centric
  - **N8n** Ã¢â‚¬â€ bridge from Zapier to more complex automations
  - **Gumloop** Ã¢â‚¬â€ built specifically with AI in mind
- These are visual interfaces to doing things with code
  - Don't actually have to look at code much
  - What you do see can be created by an AI model
- Important shift: Not just outputting media or text
  - Real **workflow automation**
  - Using tools to **do work** vs. getting information or creating assets

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Gumloop or N8n visual workflow diagram
- Display the workflow with readable parts
- Each component of the workflow should be clearly labeled and understandable

---

### Slide 15: Level 8 Ã¢â‚¬â€ Natural Language Software Creation

**Talking Points:**
- Last level of completely non-technical path
- Tools:
  - **Lovable**
  - **Bolt AI**
  - **Google AI Studio** (free, easiest place to start)
- Great for showing you can use AI to create software easily
- Good introduction to the **limits**:
  - Currently mostly front-end stuff
  - Start understanding front-end vs. back-end difference
  - Great at creating things that look good
  - Limitations: user sign-in, session data, databases, back-end functionality
- Key insight: You don't need to know code syntax to make something semi-functional
- Good playground to get comfortable with the idea

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Icons for: Google AI Studio, Lovable, Bolt
- Screenshot of Google AI Studio showing:
  - The chat interface
  - The full interface
  - Example of it creating a website

---

### Slide 16: Entering the Technical Track

**Talking Points:**
- Moving into what might be called the "technical track"
- Important reframe: Still using natural language as the interface
- AI does the technical work â€” you direct it with words
- Key difference from chat interfaces:
  - Browser/desktop apps don't have full access
  - Like how Gmail doesn't know what's on your desktop
- Command line = the underpinnings of everything on your computer
  - Before graphical interfaces (Windows, Mac OS), there was command line
  - Text-based access to everything on your machine
  - Works perfectly with language models
- The shift: AI now has full access to whatever you give it access to on your computer

---

### Slide 17: Level 1 â€” Command Line Basics

**Talking Points:**
- CLI = Command Line Interface
- First step: Learn basic navigation commands
  - How to move between folders
  - How to list what's in a folder
  - How to copy files around
- These are short, simple commands
- You can learn this by asking ChatGPT or Claude to teach you
- Commands differ slightly between Mac and PC
- The point: Get comfortable with this text-based interface to your computer
- Once comfortable, you can use AI tools that operate at this level

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Terminal window as the central image
- Visual showing terminal as a "portal" or gateway
- Connecting out to: files, photos, apps, documents on the computer
- Emphasize: text interface â†’ full computer access

---

### Slide 18: Level 2 â€” Version Control (Git & GitHub)

**Talking Points:**
- Git = versioning system for code
  - Like version history in Google Docs, but for code
  - Take snapshots of your codebase
  - Rewind to previous states if something breaks
  - Merge work from multiple people on the same project
- Why it matters now:
  - When AI is writing code, mistakes happen
  - Need ability to go back to working versions
  - Essential safety net for experimentation
- GitHub = Dropbox for code
  - Store your codebases in the cloud
  - Share with the world
  - Pull in other people's work
- Learning note:
  - Git is more complicated than it first appears
  - Initially seems simple: save, name, branch, merge back
  - Actually has fair amount of complexity
  - Worth taking time to understand properly
  - Incomplete understanding causes problems later (learned this the hard way)
- Can have AI teach you, watch YouTube videos
- Important foundation before going deeper

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Side-by-side equivalence:
  - Left: Dropbox logo â‰ˆ GitHub logo (cloud storage for code)
  - Right: Word Doc "Save" / version history â‰ˆ Git (versioning snapshots)
- Analogy visual: Folder of Word Docs = Codebase
- Drive home the parallel between familiar document workflows and code workflows

---

### Slide 19: Level 3 â€” AI-Native IDEs

**Talking Points:**
- IDE = Integrated Development Environment
  - Like Word or Google Docs, but for code
  - Interface for writing and managing code files
  - Additional features: run code, test code, scripts, GitHub integration
- You don't *have* to use an IDE (can use just command line)
  - But eventually you'll want to see what the AI is doing
  - IDE gives you visibility into the work
- **Google's Anti-Gravity**:
  - Easiest place to start
  - Can create full applications
  - Has a window just for managing the agents writing code
  - You can literally never look at the code if you don't want to
- **Cursor**:
  - Very popular option
  - ChatGPT-style chat window on one side
  - Code files and documents on the other side
  - Friendly chat interface, not command line
- Key concept: Inline execution
  - Instructions and results live on the same surface
  - Fast feedback loop
  - AI can see where code is going and what happens
  - Creates a continuous improvement loop
  - Agent writes â†’ sees result â†’ adjusts â†’ improves

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Well-done screenshot of Cursor interface showing:
  - The chat window (conversation with AI)
  - The code editor window (files being created/edited)
  - Clear view of what an IDE actually looks like
- Show the two-panel layout that makes the feedback loop visible

---

### Slide 20: Level 4 â€” Modes and Workflows

**Talking Points:**
- Moving beyond back-and-forth chat conversation
- Now creating distinct steps, using the model in different ways
- The workflow:
  - **Plan**: Create a PRD (Product Requirements Document), scope the full project
  - **Build**: Model builds based on the requirements doc
  - **Test**: Verify what was built works
  - **Review**: Code review, quality check
  - **Deploy**: Ship it
  - **Bug fix**: Address issues
  - **Plan again**: Cycle continues
- What's happening:
  - You're executing an actual software development lifecycle
  - Instead of a team, you're using one model in different modes
  - Model shape-shifts depending on the step
- Learning curve:
  - Helps to understand how software is actually built
  - Continuously refine your process as you learn
  - Easy to start, progressively deepen with AI teaching you
- Key shift: Structured workflow vs. freeform conversation

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Cycle diagram: Plan â†’ Build â†’ Test â†’ Review â†’ Deploy â†’ Bug Fix â†’ Plan
- Each step shows the model in a different "form" or mode
- Emphasize the shape-shifting nature â€” not a generic chatbot anymore
- Model transforms based on which step it's executing

---

### Slide 21: Level 5 â€” Full Software Lifecycle

**Talking Points:**
- Now handling the complete picture:
  - Deployment
  - Databases (saving data on backend)
  - Hosting
  - Domains and DNS
- Popular tools:
  - **Supabase** â€” databases
  - **Vercel** â€” hosting and deployment
  - **Cloudflare** â€” hosting, domains, DNS
- AI-assisted deployment:
  - MCP servers or CLI tools can do setup and deployment for you
  - Huge level-up if you've never deployed before
  - Easy to get lost in settings without this help
- Learning recommendation:
  - Don't just press buttons â€” learn as the AI does it
  - Have it explain what it's doing, especially when errors happen
  - Look at the interfaces even if you're not directly touching them
  - Build a general idea of what's happening
  - Over time, repeated exposure â†’ better understanding
- This is where things go live and reach real users

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Icons: Supabase, Vercel, Cloudflare
- Visual of code/app going from local â†’ deployed to live site
- Show the "sending it out to people" moment
- Maybe: laptop â†’ cloud â†’ globe/users

---

### Slide: Overarching Point â€” Learning vs. Button Pressing (Place TBD)

**Talking Points:**
- Tempting mindset: "I should know how to do this before doing it"
- Opposite extreme: Just pressing buttons, hoping something works, not learning what's underneath
- The button-pressing approach only gets you so far:
  - Won't continuously improve at using the tools
  - As tools get richer, your mental model won't keep up
  - Won't understand what's newly possible
- Reframe using the PM analogy:
  - As a PM, I wasn't doing most of the coding
  - Wasn't doing deployment, server management, scaling
  - Always depending on others to fulfill different portions
  - We fulfill our portion, trust others to fulfill theirs
- This is the same â€” just with digital employees now
  - Good to understand what's happening (notice when something's amiss)
  - But trusting others to do parts of a large project is not new
- The difference now:
  - Digital employee can do everyone else's job
  - AND it can do a lot of *your* job too
- The level-up:
  - Become accustomed to abstracting your thinking
  - Operate from the top level
  - How do I become the conductor/orchestrator as much as possible?
  - What does that afford me?
  - You can have as many digital employees as you can handle

**Visual Suggestion:**
*(TBD â€” consider conductor/orchestra imagery, or org chart with AI filling multiple roles)*

---

### Slide 22: Level 6 â€” Customizing the Harness

**Talking Points:**
- At this point, AI is not just a chatbot with turn-based responses
- It's an **agent**: chatting with itself, thinking, iterating
  - Loop: do something â†’ look at result â†’ do something else â†’ come back to you
- Analogy to delegating to a real person:
  - Give custom instructions
  - Educate them on skills
  - Provide reference materials ("here's work done before")
- Same applies to AI â€” this is called **tuning your harness**
- Components you can customize:
  - **Skills**: Markdown files that say "this skill is available"
    - AI loads skills only when needed (like Neo in The Matrix)
    - Prevents context overload
  - **Slash commands**: Shortcuts in your CLI
    - Instead of repeating instructions, just `/review` triggers a whole process
  - **Sub-agents**: Mini-versions of the AI
    - Spin off to do specific tasks in separate context windows
    - Come back with results
  - **Guidance files** (agent.md, claude.md): 
    - Overarching instructions for every prompt
    - Like a system prompt for the agent
  - **Hooks**: Trigger actions based on events
    - Recently learned about these, using them a lot now
- This is where you really start shaping how the AI works for you

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Skydiving harness imagery
- Instead of parachute: Skills, Plugins, Slash Commands, Sub-agents, Claude.md
- Each component is part of the "gear" attached to the harness
- Person wearing harness = you, the orchestrator

---

### Slide 23: Level 7 â€” Context Management

**Talking Points:**
- Context engineering was earlier â€” this goes deeper
- At the basic level:
  - You're taking written information, cutting it into tokens
  - Handing tokens to the model, getting tokens back
- Context = everything you hand over alongside your specific instruction
  - Chat history
  - Codebase searches
  - API documentation
  - Reference materials
- The goal: Get that lump of context as tuned as possible
- The problem:
  - Too bloated â†’ not enough memory for AI to understand it all
  - Starts to forget things, like short-term memory overflow
  - Models get dumber the more full their memory gets
- Session management challenge:
  - New session = no context from previous session
  - Like the guy in Memento with amnesia
- Solutions for persistent memory:
  - Write to markdown files (file system memory)
  - Write to a SQL database
  - Many approaches exist
- Multiple terminals per project:
  - Can have different sessions focused on different aspects
  - Each terminal = separate context window
  - Useful for compartmentalizing work
- Key skill: Knowing when to reset your session
  - Sometimes a fresh start is better than a bloated context
- *(Note to self: Connect back to "dumb zone" concept earlier in talk)*

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Leaky bucket filling with context
- Once it reaches the top, it overflows
- Below the bucket: a brain creating artwork on a canvas
- Overflow spills like paint onto the canvas
- The painting gets messy/ruined as too much context splashes down
- Shows: overfull context â†’ degraded output quality

---

### Slide 24: Level 8 â€” Parallel Agents

**Talking Points:**
- Using multiple sub-agents and multiple sessions simultaneously
- New challenges:
  - Managing context and memory across agents
  - Code checkout strategies â€” when agents put work back together
  - Avoiding collisions (like multiple people merging to main branch)
- Tools for parallel work:
  - **GitHub Worktrees**: Separate working directories for same repo
  - **Conductor.build**: Popular tool that uses GitHub Worktrees
  - **Beads**: Memory/context management across sessions
- Sub-agent strategy:
  - Spin up agent to do a task
  - Comes back with just the answer, not all their work
  - Prevents filling up your context with their process
- This is orchestration at scale
  - Multiple digital employees working simultaneously
  - You're coordinating, not executing

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Instead of one AI: three or four AIs running in parallel
- Each working on different tasks simultaneously
- Converging back to a central point (you, or main branch)
- Show the parallel nature of the work

---

### Slide 25: Level 9 â€” Swarms and Infrastructure

**Talking Points:**
- The edge of what's possible right now
- Large numbers of agents running simultaneously
- Tools like **Ralph Wiggum**:
  - Spin up agents in serial, over and over
  - Let it run overnight
  - Massive automation potential
- Token usage at this level:
  - Using tons of tokens
  - Need the $100-$200/month plan or more
- Beyond your local machine:
  - Everything so far = agents running while your computer is open
  - Next step: Virtual Private Server (VPS)
  - Agents running in the cloud
  - Or persistent agents on a home server
  - Doing things automatically, 24/7
- This is the edge of my current knowledge
  - Have seen it, tried a little
  - Haven't fully worked at this level yet
- Where the infrastructure meets the intelligence

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Swarm of bees, but the bees are little AIs
- Instead of a hive: a server in the cloud
- Bees/AIs constantly buzzing around the server
- Bees everywhere doing tasks
- Human figure (maybe superhero-like) conducting the swarm
- Eyes closed, arms out, orchestrating
- The bees do their bidding

### Slide: The Only Way Forward Is Through

**Talking Points:**
- The real solution: become good at it by using it
- Part of that will be a struggle â€” that's normal
- The superpower: Ask the models to teach you
  - No embarrassment about not knowing Git, GitHub, command line, anything
  - No matter how "silly" the question seems
  - You're never stopped
  - Just ask progressively simpler questions until you understand
- Personal note: I've bought courses along the way too
  - That's how I like to learn
  - But the main thing is using it to improve your mental model
- The mental model loop:
  - Use the tools â†’ modify how you think it works â†’ try again
  - Your understanding gets richer, more accurate, more potential
  - Only happens through doing
- Good news: It's changing so fast, you're not behind if you start now
  - You can stay afloat
- The danger: Putting it on the shelf for a couple years
  - The world is moving faster and faster
  - To stay relevant, this is extremely necessary
- "This doesn't apply to me" (therapist, negotiator, people-work):
  - I'd love to think through that with you
  - This will apply in places not obvious right now
  - Even if the application is just: you can learn things faster
  - Someone using this learns faster than someone who's not

**Visual Suggestion:**
*(TBD â€” maybe: person stepping forward into light/possibility, or the mental model loop visualized)*
